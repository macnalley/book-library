# book-library
A front-end webapp to track books.  

The button with the plus symbol at the top of the page brings up a pop-up form that lets the user enter book information. 

Stored books appear in a grid of cards. Each card has buttons that allow the user to toggle whether they have read the book and to delete the book from the list.
